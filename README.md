# DSA_Preactise_daily
Daily LeetCode problem-solving repository focused on consistency and interview preparation.
# Daily DSA Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms**, where I consistently solve problems to strengthen my **logic, problem-solving skills, and coding fundamentals**.

The goal of this repository is simple:
> **Code daily, build strong logic, and prepare effectively for technical interviews.**

---

## 📌 What This Repository Represents
- Daily hands-on coding practice
- Logical thinking and problem-solving development
- Consistent effort toward mastering DSA concepts
- Interview-oriented preparation

This is an **active learning repository**, updated regularly as I solve new problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

leetcode-daily/
│
├── README.md
└── solutions/
├── problem_name.cpp
├── another_problem.cpp



- All solutions are stored inside the `solutions/` folder  
- Each file corresponds to **one DSA problem**
- File names reflect the problem being solved for easy identification

The structure is intentionally kept simple to encourage **consistency over complexity**.

---

## 🧠 How Solutions Are Written
Each solution focuses on:
- Clear logic
- Correct implementation
- Readable and clean code

Basic problem details (like problem name or difficulty) may be included as comments inside the files.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Platform
- **Language:** C++
- **Platform:** LeetCode
- **Focus:** Data Structures & Algorithms

---

## 📈 Practice Approach
- Solve problems daily (1–2 problems whenever possible)
- Focus on understanding patterns and logic
- Prioritize consistency rather than volume
- Improve step by step through practice

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a strong DSA foundation that supports:
- Coding interviews
- Competitive programming basics
- Long-term problem-solving ability

---

**Consistency is the strategy. Improvement is the outcome.**
